**Class ID:** Ajunta_Pall

**Assignement ID:** CST126_3

**Unresolved Issues:**
None that I know of

**Notes:**
I use recursion in both bubbleSort and wordCount.  I wanted to make my sort array an array of pointers that pointed to the right class objects but I ran out of time.
Instead I made a second array of class objects of size 10 and assigned use bubbleSort to assign them the correct values and then print out that array
as it is it works fine and should sort the words properly
